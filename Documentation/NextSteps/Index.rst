Armed with this basic knowledge of TypoScript, you may want
to continue your exploration of TYPO3 CMS by following the
:ref:`Templating Tutorial <t3templating:start>`, which will
guide you through the creation of a whole website template
using TypoScript.

To learn more about the structure and syntax of TypoScript,
you can refer to :ref:`t3tssyntax:start`.


Finally - as was mentioned again and again throughout this tutorial -
the ultimate resource about TypoScript objects, functions and
data types is the :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>`.
